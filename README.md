## Getting Started

Clone this project and then find-and-replace `flutter_base_project` and `flutterBaseProject` with the project name you desire.

Also, change the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, because you can't upload an iOS app with it starting with `com.example`
